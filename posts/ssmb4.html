    <h1>Super Smash Bros. 4 characters BST</h1>

    <p>I made a little app in C++ that puts Super Smash Bros. 4 data into a Binary
    Search Tree, and then lets you, the user, search a character rank and the
    universe they’re from. You can also find a character by searching their
    rank.</p>

    <p>Before doing any of that, I made a small Python script to scrape the Super
Smash Bros. 4 data and put it all in a csv.</p>

    <p>Here’s an example of a query using a character’s name:</p>

    <img src="" alt="query samus">

    <p>And an example using a character’s rank:</p>

    <img src="" alt="query rank 5">

    <p>There are a couple more things that the user can do such as print out all
    of the data which includes every character’s name, rank, and universe.</p>

    <p>The project is small, but it still has a few bugs. Although I am posting
    this project today, the project itself is from 4 years ago.</p>

    <p>Here’s a link with instructions on how to set up and run it.</p>
