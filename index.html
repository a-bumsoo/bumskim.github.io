	<h3> Web app idea </h3>
	<p>
	  Teach how to program. UNHEARD OF! Anyways, the web app will present
	  content in a very beautiful and readable style. It'll follow a very
	  minimalist design style. And I don't want to have the user use a text
	  editor on the website. I'd like to get the user to dip their feet in
	  using their own tools. I'll give a variety of recommendations for
	  things such like text editors and if they don't want to choose and
	  just want to go on to code I'll tell them to go with a certain one.
