        <h2>What is an operating system?</h2>
        <p>
            An operating system is the platform on which everything you see, as
            well as a lot of things you can't see, run on. The operating system
            does a LOT of things. Too many to explain every piece in the short
        amount of time that I have right now. But I'll slowly add more to this
        website every day or every other day when I have time.
            <br>
            For now, I'll try to explain what your computer would be without an
        operating system. Without an operating system you can do almost nothing,
        especially the things that most people do every day on a computer. You
        can't browse the internet, you can't photoshop, you can't write programs
        in high-level programming languages like Python, C++, Java, Ruby, etc.,
        you can't look at photos, you can't watch videos, and so on. I'm pretty
        sure you can't even access the data inside of your hard drives.
        Anything you ever save, download, or create on your computer gets stored
        on the hard drive.
            <br>
            Your computer, like literally your physical computer, which you can
        touch and hold, would be pretty much useless without an operating
        system. Everything that is inside your computer (hard drives, graphics
        card, processor, memory) is made available to you only through the
        operating system + keyboard and mouse. <b>The operating system is the main
        software that sits on top of your hardware in order to manage how the
        'little' software (Safari, Chrome, Garageband, Sublime, etc.) and external
        devices (keyboard, mouse, flash drive(USB)) interact with the hardware
                that's in your computer.</b>
            <br>
            Ask me questions about the things that don't make sense or about
        parts of the explanation that seem incomplete. I'm really bad at
        answering questions so I may not have even answered the question.
            <br>
            Examples include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Windows 10 (current)</li>
                <li>Mac OS X</li>
                <li>Linux</li>
                <li>iOS</li>
                <li>Android</li>
            </ul>
            There are many others, but these are the most common ones today. At
            least, as a consumer.
            <br>
            <h2>Brief description of Linux/UNIX</h2>
            As you may have noticed in the list of examples, Linux is an
        operating system. Linux is kind of different from Windows 10 and Mac OS
        X in the sense that it has many different flavors. Linux has what are
        called distributions. These are just different variations of Linux.
        But underneath it all, all the Linux distributions are the same. But all
        you have to know is that Linux is just another operating system just
        like Windows and Mac OS X. UNIX is actually also an operating system,
        but it's not really used itself anymore. UNIX was a really 'barebones'
        operating system. Like a prototype for an operating system if you will.
        Linux and Mac OS X are based off of UNIX. Meaning that they took most of
        what was UNIX and built a whole lot of things on top of it to make
        what's now known as Linux and Mac OS X.
            <br>
            Again, ask me questions about the things that don't make sense or about
        parts of the explanation that seem incomplete. I'm really bad at
        answering questions so I may not have even answered the question.
