        <h2>What is an operating system?</h2>
        <p>
            An operating system is the platform on which everything you see, as
            well as a lot of things you can't see, run on. </br>
            Examples include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Windows 10 (current)</li>
                <li>Mac OS X</li>
                <li>Linux</li>
                <li>iOS</li>
                <li>Android</li>
            </ul>
            There are many others, but these are the most common ones today. At
            least as a consumer.
