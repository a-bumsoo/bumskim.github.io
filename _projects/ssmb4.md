title: "CSCI 2270 Project: Super Smash Bros. 4 query in a BST"

A made a little app in C++ that puts a bunch of Super Smash Bros. 4 data into a
Binary Search Tree, and then lets you, the user, search a character rank and the
universe they're from. You can also find a character by searching their rank.

Here's an example of a query using a character's name:

![Query samus](/assets/images/samus.png)

And an example using a character's rank:

![Query rank 5](/assets/images/rank5.png)

There are a couple more things that the user can do such as printing out all of
the data which would include every character's name, rank, and universe.

The project is small, but it still has a few bugs. Although I am posting this
project today, the project itself is from 4 years ago. It looks like the last
change I made was May 1, 2016.

Here's a link with instructions on how to set up and run it.
