title: "CSCI 2270 Project: Super Smash Bros. 4 query in a BST"

I made a little app in C++ that puts Super Smash Bros. 4 data into a Binary
Search Tree, and then lets you, the user, search a character rank and the
universe they're from. You can also find a character by searching their rank.

Before doing any of that, I made a small Python script to scrape the Super Smash
Bros. 4 data and put it all in a csv.

Here's an example of a query using a character's name:

![Query samus](/assets/images/samus.png)

And an example using a character's rank:

![Query rank 5](/assets/images/rank5.png)

There are a couple more things that the user can do such as print out all of
the data which includes every character's name, rank, and universe.

The project is small, but it still has a few bugs. Although I am posting this
project today, the project itself is from 4 years ago.

Here's a link with instructions on how to set up and run it.
