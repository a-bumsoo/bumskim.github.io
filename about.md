### Who am I?
I'm an average college student with a below average GPA studying computer science.

### What is this page for?
Right now, I'm putting this page up because I wanted to see how difficult it'd
be to use Jekyll. I was originally going to use org-mode with Jekyll and then
export my org files to markdown, which Jekyll would then use to generate this
static site, but it's actually simpler for me to just use markdown directly, so
I'm just using markdown files. 

The secondary purpose, which will probably turn into the primary purpose
eventually, is to post some of my thoughts and projects.
