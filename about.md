My name is Bum (pronounced 'b√ºm'). I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer
Science at CU Boulder and I'll be graduating in August 2020. Main interests
include recommender systems and the ethical considerations behind them, as well
as usability and efficiency considerations for programming languages. Interests
outside of computer science and programming include climbing and swing dancing.
