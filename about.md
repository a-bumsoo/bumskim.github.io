My name is Bum (pronounced 'b√ºm'). I am a fresh graduate with a bachelor's
degree in Computer Science from CU Boulder. Most of my experience is in Python
with UNIX-based environments. Main interests include learning new programming
languages, functional programming, and open source software. Interests outside
of computer science and programming include climbing and swing dancing. </div>
